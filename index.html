				<p>Like any other student, I was barely awake in my introductory linear algebra class at 8am, when I heard "Netflix." As it turns out, math is all around us. You've only been hearing that from every math nerd ever, but it's true, even when it comes to Netflix determining what shows you might like best. This was when I began realizing how broad the applications of math in CS could be. Fast forward a couple semesters, and now I'm a Math/CS major! When I'm not pursuing my degree, I also like baking, reading, and of course, watching Netflix.</p>
